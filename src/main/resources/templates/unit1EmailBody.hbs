<h1 style="font-size:16px;">Hello {{fname}} {{lname}}</h1>

<p>After reviewing your exam and other content in the course, we noticed that you were not <i>yet</i>
    meeting expectations in certain topic areas. Do not worry, these are challenging topics, and it is completely fine
    to not understand them the first time around. However, in order to prepare you for the next exam we
    wanted to provide you with some resources to improve your understanding of the content area you need to grow in.
    Please remember, programming is like music. You need to practice to become successful at it.
</p>

<p>
    Please note, these are third party resources selected by the TAs and other students. You should <b>not</b>
    sign up for anything, and none of this is required work! It is simply a third party
    option to present the topic in a different manner. These are intentionally not in a set order.
    As such, it is alright to find a resource not to your liking and quickly move to the next one.
    If you find it useful, we encourage you to return to that resource.
</p>

<h3 style="font-size:15px;">Here are some topics we encourage you to work on:</h3>


{{#if resources.[programming > fundamentals]}}
    <div id="branching">
        <h4>Fundamentals - Operations/Syntax</h4>
        <p>Here are some resources for you to look at fundamental java concepts.</p>
        <ul>
            {{# each resources.[programming > fundamentals] }}
                <li><a href="{{this.student-url}}" title="{{this.name}}">{{this.name}}</a></li>
            {{/each}}
        </ul>
    </div>
{{/if}}

{{#if resources.[programming > branching]}}
    <div id="branching">
        <h4>Branching - If/Else</h4>
        <p>Here are some resources for you to look at branching and logic in another way.</p>
<ul>
{{# each resources.[programming > branching] }}
    <li><a href="{{this.student-url}}" title="{{this.name}}">{{this.name}}</a></li>
{{/each}}
</ul>
    </div>
{{/if}}

{{#if resources.[programming > methods]}}
    <div id="branching">
        <h4>Methods </h4>
        <p>Here are some resources for you to look at method.</p>
        <ul>
            {{# each resources.[programming > methods] }}
                <li><a href="{{this.student-url}}" title="{{this.name}}">{{this.name}}</a></li>
            {{/each}}
        </ul>
    </div>
{{/if}}



<p>
As always, please know the TAs are available for tutoring time, which you can find all of our hours
    on the <a title="{{resources.course-website.name}}" href="{{resources.course-website.student-url}}">{{resources.course-website.name}}</a>.
    You can also go directly to the <a title="{{resources.canvas-calendar.name}}" href="{{resources.canvas-calendar.student-url}}">{{resources.canvas-calendar.name}}</a>
    and setup an appointment. We highly recommend signing up for appointments, as it helps us
    track our time. To signup, go to the calendar, and click the 'Find Appointment' button.
    Furthermore, Westin has a group study Fridays at 11:00 AM in COMSCI 225. You
    can signup for a slot using the canvas calendar above.
</p>


<p>These topics can be a challenge to understand, so our hope is that by taking the time to look over the
    resources provided, you will start to feel more confident in your knowledge of the content area.</p>

<p>Last but not least, we want you to know you are doing better than you realize. While we all struggle
in certain areas, to struggle is to learn. You are learning, and growing. Keep with a
    growth mindset and practice.</p>


<p>Take Care,<br/>
